#Determining dates
#Date Range: dates from which baseline days are selected 
#Weekends?: Yes or no (Can measurements be taken on weekdends?)
#Holidays? Yes or no (can measurements be taken on holidays?)
#Time range: time of day during which load can be measured 
#Load measurement frequency - minutes vs. hourly vs. monthly: how often load is measured 
#Load measurement function - avg vs. max: function applied to load measurements in a given time range and date range



#Applying function to dates 
#Avg vs. Median: apply either avg or med function to all measurements that fit the parameters outlined above for baseline load 

#Alternative: Firm Level Demand value is baseline; Firm level demand is a baseline value that the company has to meet in order to receive payment
#Add another variable called firm level demand that will be used in the payment function instead of baseline. (payment function
#will either use baseline or firm level demand)
